Please, read this guide with attention before contribute.

## Who can contribute?

Anyone of course! No matter if you are not experienced with any of the technologies that this project uses, if you have time and you want to contribute, you are welcome.

## Rules you must follow to contribute

There are only 3 rules:

  - Use tslint and respect the code formatting
  - Do not commit unusable things or any file inside the .gitignore
  - Respect the MVC (Model View and Controller) paradigm.

## In what do you can help?

A lot of thing to do yet:
  - Generate documentation (typedoc preferable)
  - Add a grunt/gulp task to transpile the typescript code and minimize it
  - Add configuration options such as:
    - Fonts
    - Colors
    - Sizes
    - etc.
  - Any other thing you find convenient
